# Hey there!

You shouldn't be creating a pull request! Read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Brunozhon/Brunozhon.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first!

## But I just spent hours fixing this bug in file X and also did some minor tweaks in file Y, and just for show, refactored all the code in file Z before going to optimize file X of 2%!

I have two things to say to you:

- Womp womp.
- Tell me in an issue instead.
