### BrunoScript intro

BrunoScript is not a proggraming languge.

It is a JavaScript libary to simplfy complex functions.

### Donload Steps

1. Donload one or more of the files in the BrunoScript folder.
2. When donload is complete, add a link to it with the folling suggestions:
  - If the file is stored at the same folder as your file, do this: *`filename.fileextensiton`*
  - If the file is stored away from the root in a folder, do this *`/foldername/filename.fileextension`* or this *`directory/foldername/filename.fileextension`*
  - If the file is stored at the root, do this: *`/filename.fileextension`* or this *`directory/filename.fileextension`*
