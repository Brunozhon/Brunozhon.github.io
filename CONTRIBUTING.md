# How to Contribute

I'm really glad you have an idea and/or bug fix to my repository, but **please do NOT open a pull request.** Here are some other ways you can contribute.

## Have an idea?

Go to [the ideas discussion](https://github.com/Brunozhon/Brunozhon.github.io/discussions/105) and suggest an idea there. More information will be posted there.

## Have a bug fix?

Open a new [issue](https://github.com/Brunozhon/Brunozhon.github.io/issues/new). Remember to be descriptive, and include:

- How to reproduce the bug (if applicable)
- Steps to fix the bug (if you want to)

## Forking

You can fork my repository if you want to make any changes to it, but good luck trying to make me accept a pull request that changes all the links to rickrolls! (I did that to [one of my friends (who recently changed their username)](https://github.com/infinitexlks) before, and let's just say he wasn't pleased.)

## That's it!

Thank you for reading this document! I hope this will help you figure out how to contribute to my repository!
